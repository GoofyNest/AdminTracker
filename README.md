# Facepunch administrator tracker
> Made for official servers with the name **"**Facepunch**"**
>
> Reason for release: Got pissed cause admins guarding Low pop servers

# How to Build
> Visual Studio Community 2022
> 
> Should work with any net framework version

# How to use
- After running the program a folder will be created called "config"
- Make sure to setup steamPath and gamePath correctly so it can find the required files

## steamPath example:
- "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam"

## gamePath example:
- "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Rust"

## Works best for
- Servers with below 100 population
- Public steam profile, private profiles dont update the player list accurately
- Also works for higher pop servers but based on your Network/Render
- Admin notifications might be delayed on Higher population servers but at least you will know it was a manual ban
